#Deployment:
Please note, this bot was created for Startrade specific use without broader deployment in mind. You are welcome to use or adapt the code for your own purposes (As long as you follow the license, which includes making freely available a copy of your complete associated source code) but its offered as is and I may introduce breaking changes without notice; this is an in-dev project.

- Create a bot in the discord dev portal
- Install postgresql. Create a db user with read/write access for the bot to use
- Clone repo, obviously
- install requirements.txt
- Authorize google sheets api on your account and create a token.pickle file in your repo
- Create a file called 'privatevars.py' in the base directory and populate it with:
TOKEN = 'your token from dev portal'
DBUSER = 
DBPASS = 'your username and password from postgre
- Create a database named 'startrade' in postgresql. Its hardcoded to use this name but you can change it in database.py or refactor the name out if you like
